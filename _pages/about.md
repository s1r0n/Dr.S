Greetings and welcome. My name is Mike. I am an Associate Professor of Sociology at Athabasca University (AU). PhD. from the University of Alberta, Masters from University of Regina. At AU I coordinate [introductory sociology](https://www.athabascau.ca/syllabi/soci/soci287.html), the [sociology of religion](https://www.athabascau.ca/syllabi/soci/soci231.html), [statistics](https://www.athabascau.ca/syllabi/soci/soci301.html), [introduction to social movements](https://www.athabascau.ca/syllabi/soci/soci288.html), and the [sociology of information technology](https://www.athabascau.ca/syllabi/soci/soci460.html).  In the past, I have been coordinated or created several additional courses, including theories of social change (Sociology 435) and Canadian society. 

In addition to all that course work, I do a little bit of publication in scholarly journals (THB, just enough to get by) and a lot of writing, editing, revising, and shaping the things I've already written. I also spend a lot of time thinking about how to organize everything, and a lot of time reorganizing, particularly as information technology has evolved, organizing things. The organizational component is a big thing and has taken a lot of time. I retain my sanity by always focusing on the improvements and never spending too much time on the tasks ahead. If I did that I'd surely lose all hope.

## Early Career

I started my career off interested in typical sociological things like the Labour Process, inequality, and gender.  In my third year of I authored the article ["Subjectivity and the Labour Process: A Case Study in the Food and Beverage Industry](http://s1r0n.github.io/Dr.S/files/sosteric-1996-subjectivity-and-the-labour-process-a-case-study-in-the-restaurant-industry.pdf)," published in the esteemed journal *Work, Employment & Society in 1996*. This paper offered a groundbreaking analysis of the intersections between subjectivity and labour within the restaurant industry, challenging prevailing notions of de-skilled and standardized work environments. It highlighted how employees developed sophisticated cultures, taking on significant training and decision-making responsibilities, thereby influencing organizational dynamics. The article has been cited 64 times, reflecting its enduring impact on the field.

Coincidentally, I entered the PhD program at about the same time that the Internet and the World Wide Web were beginning to enter public consciousness. As a graduate student I noticed right away that the WWW lowered publication entrance barriers. Basically, anybody with a computer and a bit of tech-savvy could publish a paper, a journal, or whatever. Being a budding scholarly-type, I saw an opportunity to publish a scholarly journal, and so that is what I did. Despite the vigorous protests of Nico Stehr, I created the world's very first electronic journal of sociology named, appropriately enough, the [Electronic Journal of Sociology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Journal_of_Sociology). I wrote my dissertation, ["Electronic Journals and the Transformation of Scholarly Publication](s1r0n.github.io/Dr.S/files/electronic-journals-and-the-transformation-of-scholarly-publication.pdf)" on the political economy of scholarly publication, got a job at Athabasca University.

This pioneering initiative not only demonstrated the desirability and feasibility of open-access publishing at an early stage, but also set the stage for broader transformations in the academic landscape, including the current emphasis, even by commercial publishers, on open-access options. I developed these ideas through a series of publications, including “Freedom from the Press,” “Electronic First, Electronic Journals: The Grand Information Future.” and “At the Speed of Thought.” which critiqued exploitative commercial publishing practices and advocated for sustainable, scholar-driven alternatives. These works have had a lasting impact, highlighting the importance of equitable access to scholarly knowledge and inspiring initiatives like the International Consortium for the Advancement of Academic Publication (ICAAP), which I later founded, While working with ICAAP I helped several scholarly journals start up or move online, including [The Trumpeter: Journal of Ecosophy](https://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.php/trumpet), [The Cornerhouse](https://www.thecornerhouse.org.uk/), and AU’s highly regarded International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning (IRRODL) (Cookson 2000).

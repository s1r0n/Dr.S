In reflecting on the ten units in this course, my biggest take 
away is that the nature of how human beings interact, both at an individual and organizational level, is 
incredibly complex. By actively participating in this course, completing the commentary, reading the 
text, writing the learning journals, I have gained an appreciation for the complexities involved in our 
social settings and interactions – how each and every one of us has different experiences and different 
socialization factors that have influenced and shaped our positions and outlooks. I find this incredibly 
interesting. It also humbles me a little bit; in nearing the end of an introductory level sociology course I
recognize the depth and complexity of the subject. I know academics study sociology for a lifetime and
there are still new concepts and new understandings to be identified. Prior to this course, I knew the 
presented social concepts existed, but I didn’t fully understand the impact they had on an individual’s 
position in society. The self reflection I’ve undertaken to complete the required learning journals in this
course is my greatest take away, particularly with how I’ve been impacted by socialization. I think it’s 
also worth a mention that since I’ve committed myself to this course and the content, I find myself 
viewing human interaction from a different perspective. As an example, I find myself thinking more 
critically about the promises of politicians, listening more attentively for microaggressions from 
customers in fast-food line-ups, or even having a more critical eye when viewing the weekly messages 
posted in the work lunchroom. I’d like to think developing that nuanced understanding to our social 
interactions is the desired outcome behind this course’s content and something I’m demonstrating in 
my everyday life.

The part in the text that discusses the nature of deviance and crime was an important topic and one that 
I found informative. Before this course, when I thought of the word deviant, I would think of being 
verbally reprimanded as a young child when I was acting out of line. The depth of the deviance concept
presented by author John Steckley was eye opening to me. Behavior and identity factors that act 
outside of the majority’s accepted views are often treated with distain and initiate reactions that are not 
positive or welcoming. Unfortunately, these reactions are often brought on from factors that are visual 
or surface level. Acting outside of “normal,” is often viewed with distain in society but it shouldn’t be. 
Deviance shouldn’t be a harmful or derogatory term; the broad and diverse make up of society is not a 
threat and should be accepted.

A few of the concepts I’ve discussed in the course’s learning journals have stuck with me. In learning 
journal number one we examined the concept of a “social fact.” This provided me with the opportunity 
to reflect on the expected behaviors I have abided by throughout my life. This has had a lasting impact 
on my behavior and influenced how I intact with those around me and society as a whole. I would not 
have gotten to this understanding without this course or without the learning journal assignments. In 
writing about my reflections on this course, what I’ve learned and how it has impacted me, I have to 
mention the Unit Six: Social Inequity and Stratification content that detailed the concept surrounding 
class consciousness. This is an important concept in the discussion of sociology and how we as humans
interact with one another. One’s social status is going to greatly impact their views, perspectives and 
general outlook on the world around them, not to mention how they interact with other individuals and 
society. Learning about my particular social class and how it developed was incredibly important. 
Reflecting on course content, I came to understand my family’s privileged middle-class position and 
how this has impacted my upbringing and social status. 

In Unit 8: Gender, Sex, and Sexuality the topic of gender was covered; this is a topic that has stood out 
to me ever since. Prior to this course, I had not given much critical thought to my gender identification 
and how it has impacted or influence my life, both in terms of the decisions I’ve made and my 
treatment in social interactions. I understand now that I was likely treated different in grade school as a 
male than my female classmates. The teachers may have demonstrated more patience and attentiveness 
when interacting with me. While it is not the only one, gender is one character aspect that impacts our 
social standing. Gender impacts our lives greatly, more than I ever thought before this course. In 
creating change for the better and improving the interactions and relationships we have with others, we need to
understand how these types of interactions – the biased manner in which gender is approached 
– can be harmful and the negative impacts they cause.

Another concept that I learned in this course and one that I can tie into past learning is the acronym 
NIMBY and its relevance in terms of global environmental issues. This term, which stands for Not In 
My Back Yard, relates to individuals, communities or countries expressing a desire to have harmful 
environmental processes actioned away from their home, community or country. In terms of 
environmental degradation, the Canadian practise of exporting plastic waste to developing countries 
would fall under this concept. I have read about this export process in the media; I have also written a 
research paper on the Canadian practise of exporting plastic waste. Before this course, I did not 
however, connect the dots to see the connection of environmental racism. I see it now. By exporting 
waste and accepting that the environmental degradation will occur in another country, in my opinion, 
Canada is committing an irresponsible act. Canadian authorities should know that a developing country
will not have the technological resources to dispose of the waste responsibly. The course teachings here
have provided me with a new perspective to a practise I was familiar with. There is something 
comforting in that; it’s proof I learned, it’s proof that the course was beneficial.

This course highlighted for me the complexities of our society and the multitude of ways in which our 
outlooks are formed, and interactions are influenced. Throughout this course I have learned about 
sociological theories, like Conflict Theory and Feminism, I have learned about socialization and 
inequity, as well as how certain personal identifying characteristics can be interpreted as deviant if they
are not accepted by a dominant culture. These topics represent a small collection of what makes up the 
study of sociology, which would take more than an introductory level course to fully grasp. But I now 
have a more thorough understanding of the concepts guiding our relationships, both on an individual 
level and an organizational level

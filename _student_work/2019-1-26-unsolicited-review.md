I have now taken Intro to Sociology 1 and 2 and I wanted to reach out to you just to let you know how much I enjoyed both classes. You have made the learning process very enjoyable for me. I appreciate your willingness to create courses that don't conform to the typical structure. You challenge students to think critically and not to simply accept the social norms that too  many people take comfort in. Thank you for opening our eyes. I also thoroughly enjoyed your book "Rocket Scientists Guide to Money and the Economy..." It was an excellent way to simplify our capitalist society. I may disagree a bit on the necessity for spirituality in changing the system but that could be my bias as a non spiritual person. It was still an exceptional book and I have already lent it out and recommended it to others.

Anyway, I'm looking forward to more of your courses as I pursue my Sociology degree. I do have Social Statistics starting in March, but am not expecting it to live up to the material in your other classes. Who knows, maybe you have found a way to even make statistics interesting.


Thanks for an excellent education.

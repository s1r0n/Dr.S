Western ideology of competition. I learned that the widely celebrated notions of competition are 
socially constructed narratives designed to benefit elite interests by pitting individuals against 
one another._

Over the duration of Sociology 288, my understanding of social movements, communication, and the power of ideas has deepened in ways I did not anticipate at the outset. 
This course challenged me academically, emotionally, and intellectually—transforming not only 
the way I perceive social injustice but also how I see my role as an Indigenous woman in a world
shaped by competing narratives. Reflecting on the coursework—ranging from analyses of the 
importance of ideas and communication in social movements to the dissection of ideologies of 
competition and the manufacture of consent—I now appreciate how intricately social change is 
interwoven with culture, history, and technology. When we listened to Michael Jackson’s “Heal 
the World” at the close of the course, it grounded my reflections in compassion and highlighted 
the urgent need to care for our collective future.

One of the most transformative lessons was understanding that ideas are living forces 
that, when communicated effectively, can mobilize entire communities. Early in the course, 
assignments on the significance of ideas and communication in social movements taught me that 
a single idea—challenging what has always been accepted—can evolve into a powerful catalyst 
for resistance. Whether examining the grassroots work behind movements like #MeToo or the 
advocacy for alternative educational methods (e.g., land-based learning rooted in Indigenous 
traditions), I realized that questioning “common sense” is the first step toward transformative 
change.

Working on my assignment about the impact of the #MeToo movement, especially in the 
context of Indigenous women's realities, forced me to confront historical injustices and 
contemporary failures in addressing systemic violence. Reports such as the National Inquiry into 
Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (2019) provide a stark reminder that the 
exploitation and violence faced by Indigenous women are not abstract concepts but real 
conditions affecting our communities. For me, these issues are not only theoretical—they are 
deeply personal. I recall a time when, during a domestic violence relationship, an ex-partner once
warned that I would “end up as one of the MMIW.” This horrifying statement was a painful 
reminder of the vulnerability of Indigenous women and of how violence is interlaced with 
betrayal, marginalization, and systemic neglect. Experiences like these have strengthened my 
resolve to be a vocal advocate for those whose voices are often silenced.

**Understanding Ideology and the Role of Propaganda**

A substantial part of the course was devoted to dissecting the concept of ideology—how 
beliefs are formed, reinforced, and used as instruments of control. Through class discussions and 
readings, I learned that ideology is not inherent or natural; it is methodically produced and 
disseminated by those in power. This became evident in our exploration of colonial ideologies—
the kind that underpinned the residential school system and contributed to the cultural erasure of 
Indigenous peoples. The explicit and covert messages embedded in our education systems and 
media have long shaped a society that, as documented by the Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission (2015), has been complicit in perpetuating injustice against Indigenous 
communities.

For example, the phrase “to beat the Indian out of the child” is not merely a historical 
cliché but a vivid emblem of the ongoing cultural trauma that Indigenous communities contend 
with today. The work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (2015) and research by Miller
(2017) emphasize that deconstructing these ideologies is critical to forming the basis for effective
social movements. My engagement with discussions on active versus passive sources of ideology
clarified how everyday practices, combined with deliberate policies, continue to uphold 
oppressive systems. This insight has reshaped my understanding of resistance: it is not enough to
address policies alone; we must also challenge the underlying narratives that sustain harmful 
practices.

**The Digital Age: Social Media as a Double-Edged Sword**

Another critical insight from this course has been the role of digital media in shaping and 
reshaping social movements. The assignment based on Sosteric’s “Why We Should Cut the 
Cord” led me to reflect on the dual nature of platforms such as Facebook; while they offer 
unprecedented opportunities for marginalized voices to connect and mobilize, they can also be 
manipulated by powerful corporate and political interests to reinforce dominant narratives 
(Sosteric, 2018). Algorithms that curate content and limit exposure to dissenting views reveal 
that social media is not the democratic panacea it is sometimes presented to be.

For Indigenous communities, the Internet provides both hope and risk. Powerful 
advocacy movements—such as Idle No More and MMIWG awareness campaigns—have 
successfully leveraged digital spaces to educate, organize, and build solidarity. At the same time, 
misinformation and algorithmic biases can marginalize Indigenous perspectives, echoing patterns
of longstanding systemic neglect (National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous 
Women and Girls, 2019). This duality has sharpened my awareness of the need to use digital 
tools critically and to push for more equitable digital discourse.

**Re-examining Competition and Embracing Cooperation**

A particularly liberating lesson from this course was the critical examination of the 
Western ideology of competition. I learned that the widely celebrated notions of competition are 
socially constructed narratives designed to benefit elite interests by pitting individuals against 
one another. As Kohn (1992) argues, the competitive framework, reinforced in education, the 
workplace, and broader society, promotes personal ambition while marginalizing collective 
efforts. For Indigenous communities—whose cultural paradigms emphasize shared responsibility
and mutual aid—this individualistic approach is not only alien but detrimental.
This realization has underscored the value of structural cooperation—an alternative form 
of organizing society, rooted in shared success and community strength. Indigenous governance 
practices, which emphasize cooperation contrary to the zero-sum logic of the capitalist market, 
exemplify sustainable ways of cultivating communities. Embracing cooperation over competition
offers a pathway not only for more inclusive social movements but also for a future where 
collective well-being genuinely takes precedence (Sosteric, 2018).

**Global Perspectives and Local Realities
**
The course further broadened my perspective by linking global critiques of industrial 
practices with local Indigenous realities. By contrasting Vandana Shiva’s Stolen Harvest with 
Christopher Quinn’s Eating Animals, I learned that while corporate exploitation manifests in 
varied forms across different regions, the fundamental mechanism of power remains the same. 

Shiva’s work reveals how the commodification of food and seeds displaces Indigenous farmers 
and undermines food sovereignty, while Eating Animals critiques the ethical degradations of 
factory farming. Both works resonate with the experiences of Indigenous peoples—whose 
struggles with resource extraction, environmental degradation, and cultural erasure are well-
documented.

By drawing these connections, the course highlighted that global systems of exploitation 
are reflected in local injustices. Indigenous communities have long been forced to resist 
extractive practices that threaten not only our land but our very identity. These global and local 
analyses reinforce the importance of reclaiming traditional knowledge and developing alternative
models that honor communal values over corporate profit.

**Listening to the Call: Transformation Through Compassion**

At the close of the course, our collective listening to Michael Jackson’s “Heal the World” 
served as a poignant reminder of the transformative power of compassion and solidarity. Though 
delivered through pop music, the song’s message is clear—it urges us to care for one another and
to foster a more empathetic, interconnected world. This resonated deeply with me, reinforcing 
the belief that our struggles for justice—whether academic, personal, or communal—are 
interwoven with a broader ethical commitment to healing the world. The song’s call to nurture a 
safe and caring global community continues to inspire my advocacy and embodies the hope that 
drives social movements.

**Personal Reflections and Real-Life Implications**

The academic insights I gained were deeply intertwined with my personal experiences. I 
vividly recall an instance during a domestic violence relationship when an ex-partner warned that
I would “end up as one of the MMIW,” a statement that has haunted and propelled me ever since.
Such moments are reminders that the statistics and theories we analyze represent raw, painful 
realities. They also underscore the importance of speaking out and advocating for those whose 
voices are too often silenced. This personal crucible has fueled my commitment to Indigenous 
advocacy and strengthens my resolve to ensure that the histories of exploitation and resilience 
are not forgotten.

**Where I Stand Now
**
Reflecting on my learning process, I recognize that I have grown from a student 
absorbing theoretical perspectives into a critical, engaged thinker committed to social justice. I 
now understand that social movements emerge from the convergence of ideas, emotions, and 
collective action; that ideologies are constructed and must be actively deconstructed; and that 
digital media, while replete with potential, must be wielded with caution. Importantly, my 
identity as an Indigenous woman—marked by both vulnerability and resilience—has given me a 
unique perspective and an inherent responsibility to advocate for a future where our voices are 
celebrated rather than silenced.

**Implications for the Future
**
The insights gained in Sociology 288 extend far beyond the academic realm, challenging 
me to reframe my approach to activism, research, and community engagement. In future 
endeavors—be it in grassroots organizing, academic scholarship, or public discourse—I plan to 
apply these critical perspectives to challenge dominant narratives and promote models of 
cooperation and mutual aid. The tools learned here are not merely for theoretical debate; they are
essential instruments for driving real-world change, as exemplified by the continued efforts of 
organizations like the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls 
(2019) and local Indigenous advocacy groups.

Conclusion

Sociology 288 has been a transformative journey—one that has taught me that ideas and 
communication are potent catalysts for change, that power is always contestable, and that our 
collective future is shaped by the narratives we choose to embrace. The convergence of academic
theory and personal experience has deepened my commitment to social justice, informing both 
my intellectual pursuits and my ongoing activism. As I move forward, I remain determined to 
challenge oppressive systems, elevate Indigenous voices, and contribute to a future marked by 
dignity, equity, and genuine solidarity. In the spirit of “Heal the World,” I hope that through 
compassion, critical reflection, and collective action, we can reshape our society into a space 
where every voice is heard and every human being is valued.

As a visiting student from the University of Waterloo, I came to SOCI 460 with a unique background that
shaped my engagement with this course’s material. Having taken CS 492 (Social Implications of Computing)
at Waterloo, which considers the impact of computing on individuals, organizations, and society and aims to
equip the student to make informed judgements about the social and ethical consequences of the deployment
of computing technologies”, I had been moderately familiarized with examining technology’s social effects.
However, CS 492 approached these issues primarily through technical ethics and computer science
frameworks, focusing on topics like algorithmic bias, privacy protection, and professional responsibility in
software development.

What drew me towards SOCI 460 was a shift from CS 492’s technical ethics approach to sociological critical
theory. Where CS 492 examined how to make computing systems more ethical within existing frameworks,
SOCI 460 questioned the fundamental power structures and ideological assumptions underlying technological
development itself. This transition from reformist to revolutionary analysis has been intellectually
transformative and personally challenging.

I apologize for the frequent comparisons to a different course that might be scattered along. A driving factor
behind my choice of this course was to see things from a different lens — I might even dare to compare their
approaches as two sides of the same coin — one being the rigorous reiteration of implementation to make
information technology serve us “best” ethically, whereas the other questioning if the insistent existence of
specific pieces of technology are serving us in the grand scheme at all.

**Most Interesting Discovery: The Hidden Religious Architecture of Technology
**
The most fascinating revelation came through David Noble’s “The Religion of Technology,” which exposed
something completely absent from my CS 492 experience: the deep spiritual and religious underpinnings of
Western technological development. This course went beyond “utopianism and dystopianism” in computing,
examining the millennial Christian expectations that Noble demonstrates have driven technological
development for centuries.

Noble’s documentation of how Francis Bacon, the Royal Society, and Freemasonry embedded religious
transcendence into technological discourse completely reframed my understanding of the “innovation culture”
I was immersed in at Waterloo. The revelation that engineers and scientists have functioned as a modern
priesthood, promising salvation through technological prowess, suddenly made sense of Silicon Valley’s
messianic rhetoric that had always seemed oddly religious despite its secular pretensions.

When tech executives promise that artificial intelligence will solve humanity’s problems or that genetic
engineering will eliminate death, Noble revealed they’re drawing on thousand-year-old religious archetypes
about recovering humanity’s lost divine nature. This connection became even more intriguing when contrasted
with Arthur C. Clarke’s “Childhood’s End” in our latest assignment, which presents transcendence as
explicitly anti-technological yet maintains the same elitist structure where a chosen few achieve salvation
while the masses face extinction.

**Most Important Learning: From Ethics to Power Analysis**

The most crucial shift from CS 492 to SOCI 460 involved moving from ethical frameworks to power analysis.
CS 492 focused on “fostering critical thought and professional responsibility” and teaching people to make
“informed judgements about the social and ethical consequences of the deployment of computing
technologies”. This approach assumes that better individual decision-making and more ethical algorithms can
address technological harms while leaving fundamental power structures intact.

SOCI 460’s Marxist framework provided a radically different analytical approach. The course’s emphasis on
the “logic of accumulation” and “logic of competition” explained technological development as serving
capital accumulation rather than human welfare. This framework predicted exactly the outcomes CS 492 tried
to address through ethics: surveillance capitalism, algorithmic discrimination, and worker exploitation through
digital platforms.

The Cambridge Analytica scandal perfectly exemplifies this difference. CS 492 would likely frame this as an
ethics violation requiring better privacy protections and algorithmic transparency. SOCI 460 revealed it as the
inevitable result of treating personal data as private property within capitalist frameworks. While ordinary
users provided their data through Facebook interactions, wealthy elites gained access to sophisticated
psychological manipulation tools that could influence democratic elections globally. This isn’t a technical
problem requiring better algorithms — it’s a structural feature of systems designed for profit maximization.

Similarly, CS 492’s examination of workplace automation and the impact on employment focused on
managing technological transitions more ethically. SOCI 460’s analysis of high-tech sweatshops revealed how
digital platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk enable “boundaryless exploitation” where workers can be
surveilled and controlled 24/7. Dan Mage’s experience working for the Obama campaign for $2.85 per hour
and Eric Limer’s account of performing “mind-numbing, tedious crap” for sub-minimum wages showed that
the “gig economy” represents systematic exploitation rather than ethical lapses.

This shift from ethics to power analysis has practical implications for my career in computer science. Rather
than focusing solely on writing “ethical” code or implementing “fair” algorithms, I now understand the
importance of questioning who benefits from technological systems and how democratic control can be
asserted over technological development.

**Most Challenging Learning: Confronting Technical Complicity
**
The most intellectually and emotionally challenging aspect involved confronting my own complicity in
systems of technological domination. CS 492 positioned computer scientists as potential reformers who could
make technology more ethical through better design choices. This was comfortable — it suggested that
technical expertise could solve social problems while maintaining our privileged position within technological
hierarchies.

SOCI 460’s analysis of surveillance capitalism forced me to recognize that the skills I’ve developed may
directly serve systems of control and exploitation. Training to write efficient algorithms, design user
interfaces, and optimize data processing — skills CS 492 presented as ethically neutral tools — enable the
very surveillance and manipulation systems the course critiqued.

Understanding Michel Foucault’s analysis of panoptic surveillance made me realize that platforms like
Facebook represent sophisticated behavior modification systems, not neutral communication tools. CS 492
covered “privacy and social control” and “public perception of computers” but approached these as problems
to be solved through technical means rather than as inherent features of systems designed for profit extraction.

The revelation that social media platforms were designed from inception to be addictive — using what former
Facebook president Sean Parker called “narcotic-like, slot-machine effects” — forced me to confront how my
technical training contributes to these manipulative systems. Every time I optimize an engagement algorithm
or improve recommendation systems, I’m potentially contributing to the addiction and manipulation
mechanisms the course exposed.

**Transformation of Belief System: Beyond Technological Solutionism**

This course fundamentally challenged the technological solutionism that permeates computer science
education. I was taught that technical innovation represents human progress and that social problems can be
addressed through better and ethical technology. For example, CS 492 examined “utopianism and
dystopianism” in computing but generally maintained faith that informed ethical analysis could guide
technology toward positive outcomes.

Frank Webster’s critique of information society theories challenged this assumption by demonstrating that
quantitative increases in information technology don’t necessarily produce qualitative social transformation.
His analysis forced me to reconsider what constitutes genuine progress and whether technological capability
automatically translates into human liberation.

This transformation extends beyond academic understanding to fundamental questions about my career
trajectory in computer science. The course taught me to be deeply skeptical of Silicon Valley’s “move fast and
break things” mentality and its promises that disruptive innovation will solve social problems. Instead, I now
recognize that technology deployed within existing power structures typically reinforces rather than
challenges those structures.

**Emotional Challenges: From Privilege to Responsibility
**

The emotional dimension of this learning process was more intense than anything I experienced in my
previous courses. Computer science education generally presents technical work as ethically neutral and
socially beneficial. We’re encouraged to see ourselves as innovators solving humanity’s problems through
clever algorithms and efficient systems.

Reading about high-tech sweatshops and surveillance capitalism generated feelings of guilt about my
privileged position within technological hierarchies. As a student with access to high-quality education and
generally favourable career prospects, I benefit from the same systems that exploit gig workers earning
sub-minimum wages on platforms I might someday help build or maintain.

The surveillance material produced anxiety about my own digital footprint and complicity in data extraction
systems. CS 492 covered privacy and security issues from a technical perspective, focusing on cryptographic
solutions and data protection protocols. SOCI 460 revealed how these technical protections are largely
irrelevant when users voluntarily provide personal data to platforms designed for behavioral manipulation.

Most challenging was confronting the implications of Noble’s analysis of technological spirituality. Computer
science culture at Waterloo is permeated with exactly the millennial expectations Noble documents — a
certain sort of belief that artificial intelligence will solve climate change, that biotechnology will eliminate
disease, that space exploration represents humanity’s transcendent destiny. Recognizing these as religious
rather than rational commitments forced me to question fundamental assumptions about technological
progress and my role within technological development.

However, these emotional challenges ultimately proved productive. The discomfort forced me to move
beyond passive acceptance of technological inevitability toward more critical engagement with the social
implications of technical choices.

**Conclusion**
The course concluded with important questions about whether humans can gain democratic control over
powerful technologies before they cause irreparable harm through ecological destruction or authoritarian
manipulation. These questions feel particularly urgent for someone entering the computer science field, where
I’ll be directly involved in building the systems that shape social relations.

SOCI 460 suggests that achieving democratic control requires both educational and structural interventions.
Computer science education needs to incorporate critical analysis of power relations and structural constraints,
moving beyond the ethical frameworks that currently predominate. Simultaneously, democratic institutions
need the capacity to regulate powerful technologies in the public interest rather than allowing private
corporations to deploy them according to profit maximization logic.

Most importantly, the course demonstrated that technology is socially constructed and can therefore be
reconstructed according to different values and priorities. This recognition provides hope for computer
scientists who want to contribute to human liberation rather than domination. However, it requires abandoning
technological solutionism in favor of solidarity with broader social movements working for structural change.

This represents the most valuable outcome of my time as a visiting student at Athabasca University —
learning to see beyond the mystifying rhetoric of technological transcendence toward the concrete social
relations that shape technological development, and discovering the possibility of changing those relations
through critical analysis and collective action

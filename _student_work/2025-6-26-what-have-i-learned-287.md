I walked into this course thinking I was relatively informed and 
steadfast on my views of the “reality” of the world. I’m a mom in my 40s, 
raising three kids, running a business, showing up for clients, and going back
to school to finish what I started years ago. I assumed sociology would offer 
some insight, but mostly just reinforce what I already understood: people are
different, systems aren’t always fair, and we’ve all got a role to play. I didn’t 
expect to be peeling back layers of my own upbringing and questioning the 
rules I’ve been following most of my life.

One of the first things that really shifted how I see things was learning 
about social facts. The idea that these expectations and behaviours we take 
as truth or fact, like the importance of post-secondary education, aren’t just 
personal or family-based but a curated society enforced, changed 
everything. I’ve lived my life with the belief that going to university was the 
mark of success. Not just academic success, but success as a human being. 
When I didn’t follow that path after high school due to serious mental health 
struggles, I internalized it as personal failure. But now I can see how deeply 
that expectation was ingrained, not just by my family, but by the 
neighbourhood I grew up in, the school system, the media, and even the 
subtle ways friends and acquaintances spoke about what mattered.

Class content and learning activities on inequality, capitalism, and 
indoctrination hit hard. Debt was always framed as necessary and 
respectable in my world. Taking on a mortgage or student loans was seen as 
responsible, a sign you were investing in your future. But reading Sosteric’s 
breakdown of debt as a tool of control has had a substantial influence on me 
and forced me to take a critical look at my own values. I realized how debt 
has kept me working, striving, and never really feeling like I’ve “arrived.” Add
in the fact that so much of my time has gone into unpaid caregiving, raising 
children, and emotional labour that doesn’t translate into a paycheque or job
title, and it becomes painfully clear how invisible and undervalued that work 
is.

It also helped me understand why school never quite felt like a place of
discovery, it was always about structure, performance, and compliance. The 
hidden curriculum opened my eyes to what I’d internalized: show up on time,
follow the rules, memorize the right answers, and look to authority for 
validation. That experience didn’t stop in grade school. It shaped how I 
interact in the workplace, how I show up as a mother, and how I feel pressure
to perform in ways that have little to do with actual learning or purpose. I 
really see this now as not only a student myself for decades, but as I watch 
my children go through the educational system. Each with their own 
strengths and weaknesses or challenges. It shines a spotlight on some 
unsettling truths.

Gender socialization has probably been the most personal piece of this 
course. I’ve always identified as female, but I never questioned how much of 
what I thought was "me" was actually learned. Being told I could do anything
while being expected to stay polished, agreeable, and nurturing sent a very 
clear message: push forward, but not too far. I was never physically 
punished, but emotional and psychological pressure shaped everything, how 
I dressed, how I moved through the world, how much space I was allowed to 
take up. When I liked sports and avoided dresses, I felt the tension. When I 
chose dance, I was told to leave my other interests behind because serious 
girls don’t mix grace with grit. That same pressure followed me into 
adulthood. I stayed home part-time with my kids and built my business in 
between, but somehow, despite all that work, I still feel “behind” compared 
to people who climbed the corporate ladder uninterrupted. Almost as though 
we are taught to compare and judge as a subconscious and coercive tactic.
Looking at media through this new lens brought greater clarity. 

Reading about the role of films like Star Wars in reinforcing hierarchy and 
ideas of power didn’t make me love movies any less, but it did make me 
more aware. It also has me questioning movies my almost twelve-year-old is 
watching. I am no longer able to just watch a movie without watching with a 
critical mind. These stories teach us who holds power, who deserves to lead, 
and who can be sacrificed along the way. Just like school taught us to follow 
rules, these narratives teach us to idolize the elite and overlook the people 
doing the actual work.

When we connected all of this to climate change, it was like the final 
puzzle piece snapped into place. The communities suffering most from 
environmental destruction are rarely the ones creating it. Yet they’re the 
ones told to recycle harder or make better choices, while corporations 
continue to pollute. It’s another example of how inequality isn’t just 
happening, it’s structured. It’s passed down. And we’re so used to it that we 
stop seeing it for what it is. I was always aware that the people who have the
least impact on the climate are usually the ones who are asked to change and sacrifice the most. This is evident when the world’s so-called 
philanthropists fly in their multiple private jets to talk about what the little 
people need to do in order to save our climate. It’s a sad reality that I feel 
doesn’t command the attention and thought it should that includes looking 
at the role of big corporations and elites in the deteriorating climate.

What I’ve really come to understand is that inequality isn’t just 
unfortunate, it’s intentional. It’s baked into our schools, our work 
environments, our media, and even our spiritual tools. The version of Tarot I 
once used in my personal life, thinking it was a mystical and healing 
practice, has roots in elite European culture. Even that has a class story 
beneath the symbolism. Nothing is as neutral as it seems.
I’m not looking to shift my entire belief system and values overnight. 
I’m still raising my kids, trying to make a living, and figuring out what’s next. 
But I am looking at things with more clarity and less guilt. When I feel like I’m
behind or not enough, I now stop and ask: who benefits from me believing 
that? Whose values am I following? What stories have I been handed that I 
didn’t even agree to?

This course didn’t hand me a new belief system, but it gave me a 
clearer view of the one I’ve been living in all along. It helped me name the 
invisible pressures, challenge the stories I used to accept without question, 
and step back into ownership of how I define success, value, and identity. 
I’ve realized that the systems we live in were built by people, not for 
everyone’s benefit, and that means we could (theoretically) rebuild them 
differently. I fear this is very unlikely however. That, for me, is the most 
empowering thing I’ll take away from all of this.

As an added thought I would also like to share that your feedback on 
my essays triggered me at first because you asked me questions and gave 
feedback that really made me question and dig deeper. It has also allowed 
me to find greater introspection that I likely would not have done.

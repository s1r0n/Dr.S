When I enrolled in SOCI 460, I thought I would be learning about algorithms, digital
infrastructure, and maybe some history about computers or the internet, I didn’t expect this course to
hit so close to home. I had no idea I would end up thinking about the Catholic Church, the masculine
foundations of science, spiritual longing, Facebook content moderators, or the invisible hands that
curate and control my daily life. More than that, I didn’t expect to be sitting with guilt, grief, awe, and a
renewed sense of responsibility.

I came into this course as someone who has spent 15 years working for the Department of
Justice. I’ve seen what bureaucracy looks like from the inside. I’ve seen how distant decision-makers
often never read the case files that could change someone’s life. I’ve spent hours pouring my effort into
something I know will be overwritten or dismissed. That powerlessness? I thought it was just part of the
job. But now I can name it—I can see the technocratic structure behind it. And I can trace that structure,
as we did in this course, all the way back to the religious roots of Western science and the elevation of
the "useful arts" as a kind of salvation.

It was strange—but powerful—to see how deeply connected technology is to old ideas about
divinity, transcendence, and power. Reading David Noble was like having someone finally explain the
unspoken beliefs I sensed all around me but could never put into words. The belief that technology will
save us. That the people who control it know better. That progress is always good. That those who fall
behind are somehow at fault. These are not neutral assumptions. They are deeply spiritual, and they
serve a very specific kind of elite.
And that realization hurt. Because I’ve benefitted from those beliefs too. I’m a white man. I’m
educated. I work in government. I carry a certain authority, even if I don’t always feel it. But I’m also
queer. I’ve been othered. I know what it’s like to have your identity treated like a problem to be solved.


And so, I live in this in-between place—both inside and outside the systems we studied. That tension
shaped how I received every lesson in this course.

Reading about high-tech sweatshops hit especially hard. The idea that someone is sitting at a
desk in Nairobi or Manila watching hours of violent or traumatic content so that someone like me can
scroll Instagram without seeing horror? That shook me. And it made me think about the parts of my own
job that feel sanitized or hidden. What gets left out of reports? What gets filtered out before it ever
reaches those with the power to act? Who is doing that labour, and at what cost?

I felt a lot of emotions during this course. Guilt, for sure. Not the kind of guilt that’s fleeting or
abstract, but the kind that lingers—that settles in your stomach when you realize you’ve been complicit
in something bigger than you understood. I’ve worked in EDI spaces long enough to know how systems
reproduce inequality. I’ve spoken the language of “diversity” and “inclusion” in boardrooms, helped draft
policy documents, and attended countless workshops. But this course gave me a new vocabulary—a
deeper one. It pushed me beyond the surface of equity work and into the core of how technology itself
is structured to favour some and exclude others. That realization hurt. It made me revisit decisions I’ve
made, emails I’ve sent, and even the tools I’ve used in my day-to-day work at the Department of Justice.
I also felt grief. Grief for how thoroughly we’ve been sold the myth of neutrality. That technology
is just a tool, just code, just hardware—when it’s so clearly embedded with values, biases, and
ideologies. Grief for the people whose lives are shaped and sometimes broken by systems that were
never built with them in mind. Whether it was learning about Kenyan content moderators or reading
about surveillance capitalism, I found myself mourning a kind of innocence I didn’t even know I still had.
But alongside that grief and guilt, there was also joy. Joy in learning—real learning—that doesn’t
just fill your head, but challenges your understanding of the world. Knowing that Noble, Clarke, Bernal,
and many unnamed others—have been wrestling with the same contradictions, the same fears and
hopes. That sense of solidarity, even with people I’ll never meet, was incredibly grounding. It reminded
me why I chose sociology in the first place: not to memorize theories, but to understand people, power,
and the possibilities of change.

Childhood’s End was a surprise for me. I didn’t expect to connect so much to a science fiction
novel (mostly because I am a fantasy person), but Clarke's story spoke to something real. That idea of
transcendence—of becoming something more than human—sounds beautiful at first. But then you
realize what is being given up: individuality, emotion, connection. It made me think about the queer
community and how much we’ve fought just to be seen, to be heard, to exist as ourselves. The thought
of dissolving that uniqueness into some collective cosmic being felt, frankly, a little horrifying. And yet,
the novel wasn’t dismissive. It asked me to sit with that discomfort.
That’s what this course asked of me, time and time again—to stay with discomfort rather than
bypass it. It challenged me to pause, to really sit with the unease, and to explore what it was trying to
teach me. It reminded me of one of my favourite phrases: “get comfortable with being uncomfortable.”
Whether it’s in the gym or in the classroom, that discomfort is often where the most meaningful growth
begins.

One of the most transformative ideas for me was the concept of surveillance. I had always
understood it in a vague way—as something "out there," done by governments or corporations. But this
course helped me see how surveillance lives in our daily lives. How it is designed into our apps, our
workplace reporting systems, even our charitable efforts. Volunteering with Cornerstone Housing for
Women, I’ve seen how surveillance can feel like care—until it isn’t. Until it becomes control.
And so I come out of this course changed. Not in a dramatic, everything-is-different way. But in a
quieter, more rooted way. I ask different questions now. When I hear about a new app or a workplace
efficiency tool, I wonder: Who benefits? Who is harmed? What ideologies are baked into its design?
I think that’s what sociology does best. It teaches us to slow down our thinking. To pause before we
accept the story we’re being sold.

I’m proud of the work I did in this course. It wasn’t always easy. Some readings were dense.
Some topics were painful. But every assignment felt like a step closer to clarity. And as I prepare to
graduate from Athabasca with my major in sociology, I feel a deep sense of gratitude for what this course
gave me.

It reminded me that I have power. That I can use my position—in government, in community, in
identity—to ask better questions and push for better answers. It reminded me that being uncomfortable
is not something to avoid, but something to learn from. And it reminded me that even in systems built
on hierarchy and exclusion, there is space for hope, creativity, and change.
This course didn’t just teach me about technology. It taught me about people. About myself.
About what it means to live ethically in a world shaped by machines and myths alike

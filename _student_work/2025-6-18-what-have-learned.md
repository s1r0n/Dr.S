I initially believed that this course would only introduce me to the fundamentals of social
institutions including family, religion, education, and race. However, after reflecting on the entire
semester, I've concluded that this course not only imparts knowledge but also symbolizes a
conscious awakening. From the standpoints of social structure and ideology, it forced me to
reevaluate my life experiences and comprehend "who I am," "why I have become who I am
today," and "how I should change."

I've learned that culture is an intangible power from studying Unit 3. I've started to realize that
culture is a set of values ingrained in our everyday lives rather than merely festival rituals or
familial traditions. I thought about my family's behavioral norms: we value education, observe
customary holidays, and place a strong emphasis on deference to elders. I now realize that these
are reflections and replications of the dominant societal and cultural norms, which I previously
believed to be just "family styles." I understand that culture is not innocuous. It suppresses
"different" voices while regulating our behavior in a variety of ways. Obedience can occasionally
be interpreted as disrespect for one's own character rather than respect for the other person.

The phenomena of "identity inconsistency" was evident when I examined my identification as a
part-time waitress and my role as a "college student" in Unit Four. I do well in school, but I also
have a low-status, low-paying work where I must follow rules to the letter. This conflict helps me
understand that social identity is built collaboratively by the social context, cultural norms, and
economic background rather as being solely a personal choice. Role norms, expectancies, reward
and punishment systems, and self-identity are some of the ways society molds our behavioral
patterns. I became aware that roles and identities are socially constructed as a result of this. In 
the meantime, I have also learned how to be more explicit about who I am, both now and in the
future. I finally grasped the idea of "labor exploitation" from a global viewpoint in Unit 6 after watching
the documentary "The True Cost" and studying Marx's class theory. I once believed that I could
alter my destiny if I put forth a lot of effort. However, it is now evident to me that the capitalism
system has consistently increased the wealth disparity. Under the logic of capital's pursuit of
profit, the existence of female workers in the global south who are exploited by low wages and
face health risks is not an accident; rather, it is an unavoidable consequence. Our "freedom of
consumption" is founded on a "life of exploitation" over which others have no control, I started
to comprehend. This prompted me to consider whether I valued my parents' class welfare and
everything I was given. As they say, "There is no such thing as a peaceful and quiet life; it's just
that someone is shouldering the burden for you." This is true.

In Unit 7 I developed a deeper comprehension of Maria Campbell's narrative. In addition to
documenting an individual's injury, this shows how racial discrimination has long imposed
various differences on indigenous communities, particularly women, and permanently denied
them the right to speak and the qualifications to access resources through structural mechanisms
like laws, education, health, publishing, and cultural institutions. Campbell is an example of how
to reduce and stop structural voices because of her passive attachment to the triple identities of
Black, Indigenous, and female. Her records demonstrate that this type of suppression can
persistently produce a sense of non-existence, leading to some members of society being
forgotten by the formal society, rather than being done only to cross a line. My experience as an
immigrant woman from a minority group is inextricably linked to this systemic constraint. I have
encountered little bias, resource disparity, and linguistic barriers, but my social obstacles are not
as systematic and startling as Campbell's. I have sensed the similarities and variations of this
structural limitation in both the stage when self-expression is universally accepted and the stage
where the accomplishments of active writing through motivation are imprisoned in the
methodical demands of a closed saw.

The section that most emotionally connects with me is Unit 8. I've been told since I was a little
child that "girls should be quiet" and "not suitable for studying science and engineering." I've
also been told to do most of the housework at home and to pick a career that is "suitable for
women." I now realize that these recommendations, which I initially believed to be motivated by
love and care, are the outcome of gender role socialization. Through the media, education, and
family, society continuously dictates to women what they ought to be, limiting their autonomy
and potential. I have started to reevaluate my notion of "female success" and have gained
confidence in my ability to challenge gender stereotypes because of studying this lesson. Women
can have a variety of skills. They are adept at secretarial work and can pick up a wrench to fix an
automobile. Gender is a social construct rather than an underlying trait. In addition to improving
my understanding of social multiculturalism's inclusive policies, this unit fortified my overall
viewpoint on how to interpret the interplay between racial inequality and other social
stratifications. With the use of sociological imagination, I was able to carefully consider and
debate everyday situations and explain both my own and other people's experiences.
I learned how ideology allows us to tolerate inequality in Unit 9. Several ideas that rationalize
inequality have been ingrained in me since I was a young child, including "Society is like this,"

"The poor don't work hard enough," and "One has to endure hardships to become a superior
person." These ideas have been ingrained in me continuously by parents, schools, movies,
television, and religion, leading me to feel that racial, gender, and societal divides are all
unavoidable and inherent. However, this training helped me to see that this "common sense" is a
product of ideological operations and a tactic employed by the ruling class to uphold the status
quo. I was able to reclaim my capacity for introspection and questioning by challenging
ideologies.

The most core transformation that the entire course has brought to me is: from regarding
problems as individual failures to a structural understanding. I no longer simply blame myself for
"why I'm not confident enough", "why my career choices are limited", or "why my family's
expectations bind me", but realize that there is an invisible but powerful social mechanism at
work behind the scenes. This has enabled me to no longer merely blame myself when facing
life's difficulties, but to start seeking a collective perspective, structural changes and social
connections. SOCI 287 is not just a textbook or a course. It is a mirror and a key. It enabled me
to see clearly the oppression that I couldn't see in the past and gave me the possibility to start a
change. The sociological perspective gives me language, concepts and the courage to question, to
analyze and to resist. No matter what profession or social position I hold in the future, I will
continue to think, act and speak out with this sociological acumen and criticality.

When I started this course, I expected it to be boring, laced with sociological theories, but what I 
encountered has been transformative. This course has fundamentally changed the way I think 
about society, institutions, and my role within them. Rather than seeing the world as a set of 
isolated problems, I now understand that most of the challenges we face like poverty, racism, 
gender inequality, environmental collapse are interconnected and systemic. Each unit in this 
course peeled back a layer of the world I thought I knew, revealing power structures and social 
mechanisms designed not to serve everyone equally but to sustain a privileged few. This course 
gave me critical tools to see through dominant narratives and to start questioning how things 
came to be and what alternatives might exist.

The course introduced several concepts that shaped my thinking, but one of the most 
transformative was the idea of the regime of accumulation, as outlined in The Rocket Scientists’
Guide to Money and the Economy. Accumulation isn’t just about making money, it’s about how 
societies organize work, relationships, priorities, and time around the constant need to grow 
capital. This helped me understand why inequality keeps getting worse. Our economic system is 
designed to extract more and more value from people and nature, concentrating wealth in fewer 
hands while producing mass insecurity. What struck me most was how deeply normalized this 
has become. We are taught to admire billionaires, even as millions live paycheck to paycheck. 
This concept helped me grasp that inequality is not accidental, it is a feature, not a bug of 
capitalism.

The Unit on Social facts taught me that our family roles, class and education, help to shape the 
way we behave. Reflecting on my upbringing, I saw how these forces influenced my values, 
responsibilities and sense of independence. This awareness has further guided me into 
understanding how the society guides my actions and how to find balance in my personal 
choices.

On research methodology and data capturing, I know better to move beyond personal opinions 
and to systematically investigate how social factors such as birth order, class, or gender affect 
individual and group behavior. By using both qualitative and quantitative methods, I can uncover
hidden patterns, validate theories, and inform policies. 

I now have a better understanding of culture as a system of shared values, norms, beliefs, and 
symbols that shape how individuals interact within society. I learned that culture influences 
social roles, traditions, identity, and power dynamics. It can promote cohesion and a sense of 
belonging but also reinforce inequality and exclusion. This insight is valuable in the study of 
sociology, as it emphasizes the role of culture in maintaining social structures, guiding behavior, 
and shaping individual and collective experiences.
The unit on socialization and social roles examined how key agents of socialization help in 
shaping our identity and the expected behaviors associated with a given status. It explained how 
we perform these roles in various social contexts and how conflict or strain can occur when 
expectations clash. 

Another important concept was deviance and how it is socially constructed. The unit on 
deviance opened my eyes to how laws and norms are created to control behavior, often in ways 
that serve elite interests. For example, drug laws often disproportionately target poor 
communities and racial minorities, even when substance use is widespread across all groups. 
Meanwhile, corporate crimes that harm thousands go largely unpunished. This selective 
definition of deviance reinforces existing hierarchies by punishing the vulnerable and excusing 
the powerful.

This also tied into the concept of social class, which we explored in depth in the units on social 
inequality and stratification. Before this course, I had a simplistic view of class as being 
mostly about income. I now see it as about power: who controls resources, who makes decisions? and who can shape the conditions of others’ lives? The capitalist class 
isn’t just wealthy, they are decision-makers who influence governments, shape public opinion, 
and mold the future. This makes class struggle central to understanding virtually every issue we 
face today. Similarly, I now view the state not as a neutral arbiter but as a tool that often 
reinforces the interests of the capitalist class. Whether it’s through tax policy, policing, or trade 
laws, the state frequently acts in ways that protect wealth and property over human needs. 
Intersectionality was another breakthrough. Learning to see how race, class, gender, and other 
social categories intersect, has given me a much more nuanced view of inequality. For instance, 
while both women and racial minorities face structural barriers, their experiences differ 
depending on how these identities overlap. A wealthy white woman does not experience 
inequality the same way a wealthy black woman does. Intersectionality helped me stop thinking 
in terms of “either/or” and start seeing how multiple systems of oppression operate 
simultaneously.

On race and racism, this course has given me more insight on how deeply embedded these 
forces are in institutions. Systemic racism isn’t just about personal prejudice; it’s about housing 
policies, school zoning, employment discrimination, and mass incarceration. These are not 
random or accidental, they are outcomes of long histories of colonization, slavery, and 
segregation that have morphed into new forms. The way Indigenous communities in Canada 
continue to be marginalized is a clear example of how colonialism is ongoing, and not historical.
With gender, I learned how patriarchy operates not just in personal relationships, but in 
economic and political systems. The gender pay gap, domestic labor expectations, and 
underrepresentation in leadership all reveal how societies value men’s contributions more than 
women’s. Perhaps the most disturbing realization was that these inequalities are not mistakes, 
they are maintained deliberately. Through a combination of ideology, institutional design, and 
brute force, elites preserve systems that serve them. This made me feel both angry and motivated
to seek change. It’s not enough to recognize inequality; we must also understand how it is 
maintained and how it can be dismantled.

The idea of (ideological institutions)[https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org/index.php/Ideological_Institution also reshaped how I perceive everyday life. Before this 
course, I viewed schools, media, and religion as mostly positive social forces. Now, I understand 
that these institutions play a key role in shaping people’s beliefs, values, and behaviors in ways 
that reinforce the status quo. We are taught to see poverty as a personal failure rather than the 
outcome of structural conditions. We are taught to believe that hard work always leads to 
success, even when evidence shows otherwise. These ideologies serve powerful interests by 
masking systemic injustice.

The unit on the environment brought everything together for me. Before this course, I viewed 
climate change as an environmental problem, melting glaciers, extreme weather, rising sea levels
and ozone depletion. Now I understand it as a political and economic crisis driven by the same 
forces we studied throughout the course. Drowning in a Climate Apocalypse made clear how 
climate change disproportionately affects the global south, poor communities, and Indigenous 
peoples. These groups are often the least responsible for emissions but suffer the most. It 
reminded me of the concept of climate apartheid, where the rich can shield themselves from 
climate impacts while the poor face disaster. This is racial, economic, and environmental 
injustice all at once.

Smog + Mirrors exposed how oil companies manufacture misinformation to maintain their 
profits. They fund fake science, manipulate media narratives, and buy politicians in a bid to 
prevent regulation and accountability. This is ideology in action, just like we saw in education or 
media. The destruction of nature isn’t a side effect as it’s baked into the system of accumulation.
I also saw how environmental collapse is linked to colonialism. Indigenous lands are routinely 
exploited for fossil fuels, mining, and agriculture, often without consent. Indigenous knowledge 
about sustainable living is ignored or erased. This reminded me of the broader theme of how 
capitalist development destroys both people and planet in its quest for profit. And the so called 
“green capitalism” appears insufficient. Simply switching to electric cars or carbon markets does 
not challenge the underlying system that demands endless growth. To truly address the climate 
crisis, we must rethink the entire economic and political system. This is a message that echoes 
everything I learned in this course.
T
his course gave me a new lens to understand not just the world, but my own experiences. I now 
see how my position in society has shaped my opportunities, beliefs, and sense of self. I 
recognize the privileges I hold, as well as the ways I have been shaped by structural forces 
beyond my control. It has also changed how I consume news, interact with institutions, and 
engage with others. I ask deeper questions now. When I hear politicians talk about “crime,” I 
ask: whose crimes? When I hear talk of economic growth, I ask: growth for whom? When I see 
corporate social responsibility campaigns, I ask: what are they hiding?

I also feel more empowered, understanding how systems work to make them feel less mysterious
and more open to change. I may not have the power to dismantle capitalism tomorrow, but I can 
resist, organize, educate, and imagine better alternatives. Sociology didn’t give me all the 
answers but it gave me the tools to start asking the right questions. This course has been a 
journey of unlearning and rethinking. From social institutions to environmental justice, from 
ideological control to class struggle, I am armed with a powerful set of tools to make sense of the
world. I now understand that society is not a natural or neutral entity, it is shaped by human 
decisions, power dynamics, and historical legacies. More importantly, it can be reshaped.

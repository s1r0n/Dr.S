teaser: I would like to say that the course exceeded my expectations. The material offered a learning experience that goes beyond the classroom and the examples provided; it is practical learning that the student can apply the concepts to everyday life. This practical applicability is what truly captivates me and makes me feel happy and fulfilled. Realizing that the concepts of social movements are not just relevant to large-scale protests, but also to the small things in daily life, made me feel more connected as a human being and a citizen. It gave me a stronger sense of how I can help and contribute to the society I live in. For me, SOCI288 brilliantly combined theory with practical application, allowing students to link each unit to the readings and their own individual experiences.

SOCI288 was the second sociology course I took, and before enrolling, I was not sure
what to expect, as I had little prior knowledge of this field of study. Coming from a career in
Mechanical Engineering and immigrating from Brazil (which brought a unique cultural
perspective and challenges with the English language), I must admit I was initially concerned
about my performance and the quality of my learning experience. Fortunately, as the course
progressed, my concerns transformed into joy as I gained valuable knowledge and found ways to
apply the content to various areas of my life.

Coming from a background in the exact sciences, I initially found it challenging to adapt
to the way sociology content is presented. In engineering, everything tends to be more
straightforward and, as the saying goes, “black and white.” However, the teaching material
provided valuable guidance on how to study sociology, enabling me to enhance my ability to
contextualize facts, analyze the broader picture, and evaluate multiple causes. The introductory
sessions, with their Concepts and Learning Outcomes, as well as the Commentary and Study
Questions sections, organized the content in a clear and accessible way. This structured approach
- introducing concepts, discussing them, and providing study questions - helped me build a solid
line of reasoning for each unit. Additionally, my tutor consistently provided valuable feedback
and promptly answered any questions I had via email. This support was very important in
helping me understand how to study the material effectively and get the most out of the course.

This organization has greatly contributed to my understanding of the concepts outlined in
the course’s Learning Outcomes. When I first enrolled in SOCI288, my views on social
movements were limited to vague personal opinions shaped by my life experiences and media
exposure, often influenced by personal biases. Now, I feel confident discussing social
movements with others, know how to look for information in the scientific community to deepen
my understanding, and can evaluate the success or failure of various movements. Through my
studies, I have gained intellectual tools that enable me to critically analyze these topics, engaging
in rational and intellectual discussions rather than emotional or subjective ones. Understanding
each concept and its contextual significance has been fundamental to this transformation.

First, understanding what a social movement is was incredibly valuable. Learning that a
social movement is a group of people working together in an organized manner to transform
realities (Athabasca University, n.d.-a) helped me truly grasp its characteristics, motives,
consequences, and weaknesses. Before the course, the term "social movement" felt very broad
and lacked a clear definition for me. However, I can now confidently identify social movements
based on the studied characteristics. Additionally, examining each aspect of social movements
was crucial to my learning, ensuring no gaps in my reasoning.

After learning that, in the context of social movements, power is defined as the capacity
to achieve results through human effort (Athabasca University, n.d.-a), it became easier to
understand its connection to money. As explained in the course material, money enables
individuals or social groups to hire human labor to perform specific tasks aiming to achieve
something (Athabasca University, n.d.-a). Interestingly, this understanding prompted an
immediate question: how can a social movement led by poor minority groups still achieve
success if they do not have money? To my relief, the answer was just a few lines away. Groups
without financial resources leverage communication to grow, gain strength, and build power
(Athabasca University, n.d.-a); and learning this broadened my perspective on social movements,
especially those initiated by smaller groups.

One factor that truly caught my attention – and was one of the topics I most enjoyed
studying – is the concept of indoctrination. To fully understand indoctrination, however, I first
needed to explore the concept of ideology. Ideology is defined as a system of ideas that guides
our expectations, goals, and actions, accepted as true without question (Athabasca University,
n.d.-b). This helped me understand where the core of a social movement lies: a shift in the status
quo from one ideology to another. This may seem obvious now as I write this self-reflection, but
at the time, it was something I had not yet realized. If a group of people is fighting for
something, it is because they seek change and want their ideas to prevail. So, what does this have
to do with indoctrination?

For an ideology to prevail, a social movement needs to be strong enough to become
sovereign. As mentioned earlier, a social movement gains more power with increased people
participation. Therefore, it is in the interest of the social movement to attract more followers –
people who are committed to the cause and willing to fight for it. Transmitting these new ideas to
individuals so that they become accepted as ideologies is the process of indoctrination. In other
words, indoctrination involves repetitively teaching and reinforcing ideas until they are accepted
as true without question (Athabasca University, n.d.-b). After reading the online content,
suggested support materials, and researching additional sources during my assignments, I came
to understand the constant attempts to manipulate various aspects of my life (and the lives of
others) by many (almost all) of the communication agents present in my life. This realization
shocked me and made me question my sense of freedom. This feeling was later validated when I
studied, in unit 3, criticisms about whether social movements can truly be democratic. My
surprise at the effects of public relations in controlling people's thinking did not end there

I have always focused on studying and reading what interests me, often leaving aside
topics that don not capture my attention. However, I came to realize the significant impact this
approach has when I learned the concept of manufactured consent. Manufacturing consent refers
to how media and public relations systems influence public perception, causing people to
passively accept and conform to "the system" (Athabasca University, n.d.-c). I had never
considered that, by not forming an opinion or taking a stance against something, I was
inadvertently allowing a particular ideology to spread. This passive compliance, fostered by the
media of powerful groups, has made me more vigilant. From now on, I will critically analyze the
information that reaches me. This shift will allow me to truly defend the values I believe in,
rather than unintentionally adhering to ideas I do not support.

Another aspect that truly caught my attention was the documentary “Eating Animals”,
directed by Christopher Dillon Quinn. Coming from Brazil, one of the leading countries in meat
and food crop production, I had always supported and advocated for large-scale production of
these foods. However, my perception completely changed after watching the documentary – it
was probably the most shocking moment during my studies in this course. As someone who
deeply cares about the well-being of people, animals, and environmental preservation, I found
myself horrified by what I saw in the documentary – and by what I read in “Stolen Harvest: The
Hijacking of the Global Food Supply by Vandana Shiva.” The cruelty involved in factory
farming to meet global demand is something that goes against my values. Moreover, the health
issues, hormonal changes, excessive use of antibiotics, and other related concerns led me to
reduce my consumption of these products and seek out local and organic suppliers. The impact
was so profound that I have shared this information with several people in my social circle and I
started to consume more products from local producers. This experience of living and
contextualizing the lessons from SOCI288 has influenced other areas of my life as well.

In the academic environment, I was able to link the topics of this course with what I
learned in the two psychology courses I took (PSYC289 and PSYC290). In these courses, I
studied the characteristics and development of personality, emotions, social interactions, tastes,
desires, and other factors related to the human mind. The connection between these courses lies
in how social movement mobilizers structure their campaigns to reach people's emotions,
recognizing that each person is unique. Moreover, human mentality often drives individuals to be
influenced by emotions, making them more susceptible to indoctrination and the manufacturing
of consent. Additionally, in psychology, I learned how each human being is unique and complex,
shaped by personal, family, cultural, historical, social, environmental, and temporal factors.

Social movement leaders address these social divergences through personalized advertising
campaigns. This is where the definition of propaganda becomes relevant. Propaganda is the
manipulation of public opinion through biased or deceptive communication across various mass
media channels (Athabasca University, n.d.-c). Its goal is to influence public attitudes and
behaviors, not only regarding ideologies (initially anti-union) but also to drive increased product
sales (Athabasca University, n.d.-c). As a result, advertising campaigns are becoming
increasingly tailored to different audiences. The core message (the ideology being transmitted)
remains the same, but because people are unique, each advertisement must be crafted to resonate
with specific groups. Therefore, understanding the audience is crucial for creating effective
propaganda strategies.

Looking ahead to future learning, SOCI288 has helped me acquire skills that were
previously challenging for me. As I mentioned earlier, coming from an engineering background,
I was not used to reading lengthy books on a central topic or critically evaluating open-ended
societal questions. I have always been very analytical, focusing on numerical data and using
tables and graphs to summarize information. However, as the weeks passed, I learned how to
approach texts more effectively and think critically about these topics. I can see my progress in
the assignments – the first ones took me much longer to complete than the later ones. This
experience of learning and skill development is something I will carry with me throughout my
life and future studies, and I now feel more confident tackling similar courses.

In a personal context, I strongly identified with the topic of cooperative learning, and I
thoroughly enjoyed reading “No Contest: The Case Against Competition” by Alfie Kohn. In this
book, Kohn argues that cooperative learning offers several advantages over competition, yielding
better individual and collective results and greater personal satisfaction (Kohn, 1992). My deep
connection with this topic comes from the fact that I have a twin brother and, therefore, grew up
with someone always by my side. Cooperation has been part of my entire life and has shaped my
values. Studying this topic helped me understand why I feel so uncomfortable competing against
others – because I have always seen more value in mutual support between people. As a result, I
have always participated in activities that promote collective efforts, such as team volunteering,
group college projects, and more. Now that I have the scientific basis for the effectiveness of
fostering cooperative environments rather than competitive ones, I am more determined to
advocate for this approach in my life and within my family. I will apply these principles in
raising my first child, who will be born in early 2025.

One of the most significant moments in my life which I could think of to apply what I
learned in this course was when I participated in person in a social movement in 2013 in Brazil.
It was called the “June Journeys” (Jornadas de Junho in Portuguese), a series of massive protests
that began over a public transportation fare hike and grew to include demands for better public
services and a fight against corruption. I remember receiving news from all directions – TV,
internet, newspapers, and conversations with family and friends – creating a mix of frustration
and unease feeling towards the government (indoctrination). This led me to join one of the
protests in Curitiba, Paraná, where thousands of people were rallying for better government
services. At that time, I did not fully understand how everything unfolded or how I got swept up
in the moment. My emotions and desires were driven by the masses. But throughout the
SOCI288 course, I was able to apply the concepts I learned to better understand the experience.

Now, I can effectively analyze how communication, the development of group power,
indoctrination processes, and the ideology of the movement all played a role in shaping the
event. I also gained insight into how the movement eventually ended – it was with the victory of
the popular masses that the government accepted the proposed changes as they were losing
popularity and social approval. This has made me feel more prepared for future situations, giving
me better control and understanding of events in my life, and making me less likely to act
passively.

Another valuable moment for me during the course was writing the Final Research Paper,
in which I focused on the Pro-Life social movement. As a Catholic, I have always supported the
Pro-Life cause, but my understanding was largely shaped by the ideologies and information
passed down through the church and my family, without much questioning on my part. While my
position on the topic has not changed after completing this research, I now feel much more
confident discussing the various aspects of the debate. Through my research, I was able to
explore the concepts related to the movement and apply the concepts and definitions I learned in
the course to better understand the social and historical context behind it. Before, I saw myself as
just a participant in the movement, but now I feel more equipped to take an active role and
contribute to spreading the values I believe in. For me, this Final Research Paper was like a mini-
internship, where I brought the knowledge from the course to the practical side of my life – that
is why I wanted to choose a topic that was part of my life.

As a final thought, I would like to say that the course exceeded my expectations. The
material offered a learning experience that goes beyond the classroom and the examples
provided; it is practical learning that the student can apply the concepts to everyday life. This
practical applicability is what truly captivates me and makes me feel happy and fulfilled.
Realizing that the concepts of social movements are not just relevant to large-scale protests, but
also to the small things in daily life, made me feel more connected as a human being and a
citizen. It gave me a stronger sense of how I can help and contribute to the society I live in. For
me, SOCI288 brilliantly combined theory with practical application, allowing students to link
each unit to the readings and their own individual experiences.

In conclusion, SOCI288 exceeded my expectations, transforming the way I understand
social movements and how I apply this learning in both my personal and professional life. The
course taught me to critically analyze social dynamics, challenge my own biases, and recognize
the impact of social movements, not only in large public demonstrations but also in everyday
interactions. The clarity of the concepts and their practical relevance have broadened my
perspective as a citizen and strengthened my ability to actively contribute to society. Regardless
of the professional path I pursue, I will carry these lessons with me and use them to promote
positive change in the world around me
